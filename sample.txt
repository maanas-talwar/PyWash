;  This is a simple program which takes in the timer, temperature, spin speed info and wash type info and executes 
;  the wash cycle for a given amount of time as present in the timer info. 
;  NOTE -
; TIM, TMP, SPS, WAT are subroutines which have specific executions

SRT
BSA TIM; Time for which we want to execute
BSA TMP; Temperature control
BSA SPS; Spin speed
BSA WAT; Wash type

LDA TM I
CMA
INC
; Loop to execute Washing of clothes
SPN; start spinning of the motor
LOP: INC
     SZA 
     BUN LOP
HLT; halt the motor

INC; AC is incremented and is now 1
STA WSH I; store AC's value in the memory location which specifies that our machine is draining ( drain - 1, wash - 0)
CLA; clearing AC
STA TM I; storing 0 in timer and temperature as we are only draining now
STA TMP I
ICL; inlet valve is cleared(means valve closed), no more water required
OST; outlet valve is set(means outlet valve opened), water to be flushed
DRN; drain the water present in the machine

; The below loop corresponds to the fact that our clothes need to be dried after ; the draining operation and thus they are dried for a CLEAN amount of time.

LDA CLN; loading CLEAN which is the amount of time for which we would drain our machine always
CMA; complement and incrementing so that negative value used as counter
INC 
SPN; start the spinning of the motor
REP:  INC
      SZA
      BUN REP
HLT; halt the motor
STA WSH I; AC is stored in the wash type and spin speed (AC is actually zero ;and thus they are set to default)
STA SPD I
STP
; Labels and sub - routines

WTP: SKI

     BUN WTP I
TM, HEX 0000 ; timer value
TMP, HEX 0001 ; temperature type
SPD, HEX 0002 ; spin speed value
WSH, HEX 0003 ; wash type
CLN, HEX 0004 ; drying time
